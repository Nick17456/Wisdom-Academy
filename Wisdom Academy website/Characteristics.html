    <article id="Characteristics">
        <p><center>The Industrial Revolution was primarily characterised by technological, economical, and cultural developments. Among the advancements in technology were the following: (1) the utilisation of novel raw materials, primarily iron and steel; (2) the application of novel energy sources, encompassing fuels and motive power—coal, steam engines, electricity, petroleum, and internal combustion engines—three—the development of novel machinery, like the spinning jenny and the power loom, enabling higher output with reduced human energy consumption; and four—a novel work arrangement known as the factory system, characterised by a greater division of labour and functional specialisation. five) significant advancements in communication and transportation, such as the steamship, vehicle, aeroplane, telegraph, and radio; and six) the expanding use of science in business. These technological changes made possible a tremendously increased use of natural resources and the mass production of manufactured goods.</center></p>
        <p><center>Numerous new advancements have occurred in nonindustrial domains, such as the following: improvements in agriculture that made it possible to feed a greater number of people who were not farmers;(2) changes in the economy that led to a more equitable distribution of wealth; the decline of land as a source of wealth in the face of rising industrial production; and increased trade internationally;(3) changes in politics that reflected the shift in economic power; and(4) broad social changes that included the expansion of cities, the growth of working-class movements, and the emergence of new patterns of authority. additionally, changes in culture on a large scale. Employees developed new, unique talents, and their relationship to their jobs changed. They were no longer artisans using hand tools, but rather machine operators under factory control. Lastly, there was a psychological shift: there was an increase in self-assurance in one's capacity to manage resources and conquer nature.</center></p>
