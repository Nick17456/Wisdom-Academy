           <h2>The revolution's positive aspects</h2>
            <p>Opportunities for work increased as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The pay at factories was more than what people were earning as farmers. As factories proliferated, more supervisors and workers were needed to run them, which raised the number of available positions and average pay.</p>

            <p>Because the majority of factories and big businesses were situated close to cities, people moved there in pursuit of employment, frequently outnumbering the supply of available homes. Significant advancements in city planning resulted from this.</p>

            <p>Higher education was a direct outcome of increased innovation, which also frequently produced a number of ground-breaking technologies that are still in use today. Among these inventions are the anaesthetic, lamp, sewing machine, X-ray, and calculator.</p>
                
            <p>The nation witnessed the first usage of an assembly line, combustible engine, and incandescent light bulb as a result of the Industrial Revolution's innovations. The Industrial Revolution altered people's living conditions, places of employment, and access to technologies. Even if living conditions for labourers remained deplorable, it made life comfortable for many. This eventually contributed to the growth of labour unions, which brought about better working conditions and equitable pay.</p>

            <h2>The revolution's negative aspects</h2>
            <p>The Industrial Revolution saw many breakthroughs, but the speed at which they happened created many problems. There was a shortage of food produced as labourers abandoned their fields to work in industries for greater pay.</p>
            
            <p>Urban pollution increased as a result of the dramatic rise in factory numbers. Not only did manufacturers contribute to pollution, but as more people moved into the cities, living conditions deteriorated due to a shortage of resources.</p>
                
            <p>In certain places, companies poured their waste into rivers, and sewage ran through the streets. Water sources were not as thoroughly examined and safeguarded as they are now. Consequently, laws and regulations were passed in order to safeguard the populace.</p>
                
            <p>Working conditions in factories declined as a result of the Industrial Revolution's incentive to boost profits. Working long hours for little pay with few breaks became the standard. Child labour was a serious problem.In the end, laws were implemented to put an end to the mistreatment of child labour. </p>
            
            <p>Despite earning less than men, a considerable number of women entered the coal and textile industries. Women started to band together and stage demonstrations in favour of greater social equality.</p>
