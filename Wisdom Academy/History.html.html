                <!-- content comes from here -->
                    <p>The shift from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine production is known as the Industrial Revolution in modern history. These advancements in technology brought about new lifestyle and career options that completely changed society.
                    While some innovations trace back to the 1700s, the Industrial Revolution really got underway in Britain during the 1830s and 1840s, and it quickly extended to the rest of the world, including the United States. The term "First Industrial Revolution" is frequently used by contemporary historians to distinguish this era from a subsequent one that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th century and witnessed significant advancements in the steel, electric, and car sectors.</p>

                        <p>About 1764 James Hargreaves, a poor uneducated spinner and weaver living in Lancashire, England, conceived a new kind of spinning machine that would draw thread from eight spindles simultaneously instead of just one, as in the traditional spinning wheel. The idea reportedly occurred to him after his daughter Jenny accidentally knocked over the family’s spinning wheel. The spindle continued to turn even as the machine lay on the floor, suggesting to Hargreaves that a single wheel could turn several spindles at once. He obtained a patent for the spinning jenny in 1770.</p>

                        <p>The water frame, dubbed so because it ran on a waterwheel, was the first fully automatic spinning machine to run constantly. Richard Arkwright patented it in 1769. Compared to the spinning jenny, it produced more and stronger thread. The water frame's size and power source prevented it from being kept in spinners' houses, as previous machines had. Rather, it needed to be situated next to a swift-moving stream in a sizable building. In Britain's mountainous regions, Arkwright and his associates constructed a number of these industries. After then, spinners—including juvenile laborers—worked in ever-bigger factories as opposed to their houses.</p>

                        <p>Samuel Crompton created the spinning mule in 1779 by fusing elements of the water frame and the spinning jenny. His device allowed a single operator to work over 1,000 spindles at once and produced both fine and coarse yarn respectively. Regrettably, Crompton's lack of wealth prevented him from patenting his concept. A group of manufacturers conned him out of his innovation by paying far less than they had promised in exchange for the idea. Eventually, hundreds of firms in the British textile sector employed spinning mules.</p>

                        <p>Water was pumped out of mines in Britain during the 17th century using antiquated steam engines. Building on previous advancements, Scottish inventor James Watt enhanced the efficiency of steam pumping engines in 1765 by including a separate condenser. Two years later, in 1781, he created a device that rotated a shaft instead of producing the pump's up-and-down action. Watt became wealthy when his engine was significantly improved in the 1780s and used as the main power source in paper, flour, cotton, iron, distillery, canal, and waterworks mills.</p>

                        <p>The steam railway locomotive (1803), an application of the steam engine that Watt himself had originally written off as unfeasible, is widely credited to British engineer Richard Trevithick. Trevithick also modified his engine to run a dredger and turn paddle wheels on a barge. Trevithick's engine quickly replaced Watt's less effective design in industrial applications throughout Britain because it produced more power at higher pressures than Watt's engine. Designed by English engineer George Stephenson, the Active (later called the Locomotion) was the first steam-powered locomotive to take paying passengers, making its first journey in 1825. Stephenson and his son designed the Rocket, a 36-mile-per-hour (58-kilometer) vehicle, for a new passenger railway line between Manchester and Liverpool that was finished in 1830.</p>

                        <p>British scientist Michael Faraday used experiments in the 1820s and 1830s to show that an electric current could be used to turn a coil of wire between two magnet poles, and that the coil itself could produce an electric current by rotating a coil of wire between two magnet poles (a process known as electromagnetic induction). The electric generator, also known as the dynamo, is a device that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy. On the other hand, the first phenomena served as the foundation for the electric motor, which transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy. Despite significant advancements in the mid-19th century, the widespread use of motors and generators depended on the subsequent development of other devices, such as electrically driven trains and electric  lighting.</p>

The London Underground, the first electric portion of the city's tube system, was operational by 1890.</p>

                        <p>Nearly concurrently, the United States and Britain developed the first workable electric telegraph systems in 1837. The British inventors William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone created a mechanism in which an electric current flowing via connecting wires caused needles on a mounting plate at a receiver to point to particular letters or numerals.  The electric telegraph was invented by Solomon G. Brown, Joseph Henry, Samuel F.B. Morse, and Alfred Vail. Brown was one of the main technicians for the device, Henry made the essential high-intensity magnet, and Morse came up with the basic ideas for the telegraph, which Vail significantly improved. In addition to inventing the electric telegraph, Morse is most known for developing the universal code that is now called Morse Code, which can be, The code, which consists of a series of dashes, dots, and spaces for symbolic meaning, was quickly adopted globally (albeit with modifications to allow for diacritical marks). In 1844, a demonstration telegraph connection was finished connecting Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.</p>

                        <p>Scientist Alexander Graham Bell, an American of Scottish descent, invented the telephone in 1876 and successfully proved how sound, including human voice, could be transferred by an electric current. Although Bell is recognised as the telephone's principal inventor, American draughtsman and inventor Lewis Latimer made contributions to the device's advancement through his work on patent drawings. Bell's patent attorneys hired Latimer to create superior patent drawings for the phone patent application. Bell's apparatus was made up of electromagnetic coils and two sets of metallic reeds, or membranes. At particular frequencies, sound waves close to a membrane vibrate, which causes currents in one electromagnetic coil to flow to the other coil and replicate the original sound waves. When Bell called his helper, Thomas Watson, between two rooms in his Boston laboratory in 1876, it was the first successful "telephone call" ever. By the middle of the 20th century, the telephone had gone from being a curiosity or a toy for the wealthy to a regular household appliance with billions of units sold worldwide. The development of the telephone transformed technology and communication.</p>

                        <p>The steel plough, created by John Deere in 1837, was a significant advancement over older iron and wooden ploughs because it was stronger, lighter, and could penetrate the dense prairie soil found in the Midwest of the United States. The plow's flat surface and sharp point decreased friction, allowing farmers to cultivate more land in a day with less draft force. This led to higher crop yields and the expansion of farming into new areas in the west. Deere's company in the United States was producing over 10,000 steel ploughs a year within twenty years of its conception.</p>

                        <p>When compared to handheld scythes, Cyrus McCormick's invention of the automated reaper in 1831 significantly boosted harvesting efficiency. The ripe grain was cut using a cutting bar on McCormick's horse-drawn machine, the cut stems were carried by a platform, and the cut stems were pulled onto the platform for bundling using a reel. The handheld scythe, in use for more than 5,000 years, was replaced by the reaper, which allowed farmers to harvest four times as much grain per day by automating the cutting and threshing procedures.</p>

                        <p>The effective multiple-effect evaporator was created by chemist Norbert Rillieux. It boiled sugar cane juice gradually using steam heat and vacuum chambers. This transformed the sugar industry by taking out the water from the juice and keeping the sugar crystals. Compared to outdated open-kettle techniques, Rillieux's 1846 patent-protected device reduced fuel consumption and increased sugar yields, allowing Louisiana's sugar plantations to decrease production costs while enhancing quality and profitability. Many subsequent innovations were made possible by Rillieux's groundbreaking work in industrial heat transfer and steam technology. His inventive refining technique is still employed in chemical processing, pharmaceutical production, food and beverage manufacturing, and wastewater purification.</p>
